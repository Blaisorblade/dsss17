(** * Vellvm: A Larger Case Study *)

(** Our final case study on property-based testing is in the context
    of [Vminus], a compiler for [Imp] built on a simplified version of
    the [Vellvm] framework for verified compilation in the LLVM
    ecosystem.

    To get started, visit the [vminus] directory in the [dsss17]
    repository and open the file [CompilerTest]. *)
